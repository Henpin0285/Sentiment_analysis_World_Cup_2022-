# Sentiment_analysis_World_Cup_2022-

Project Proposal:
World Cup FIFA 2022 Results Prediction by using Twitter reviews.


Predictive Model to use:
To complete this project, I’ll be using NLP (Natural Language Processing) to get all the keywords related to the World Cup Final 2022 that took place just a couple of months ago. I will assess all the people comments for the final teams and then I will make my conclusions based on the most good or bad twitter comments against France or Argentina.


The steps to complete this project will be the following:
1.	Import the libraries needed to complete the tasks (Pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, etc).
2.	Retrieve the data from twitter website using webscraping. I’ll be taking official the official accounts for France and Argentina. As well as other accounts that I found useful for this purpose.
3.	Download the data and save it as csv file.
4.	Read the dataset using the pandas library.
5.	Explore and clean the dataset using built-in functions as info (), dropna (), shape () etc.
6.	Use some pre-trained models as BERT and VADER.
7.	I will analyze people’s sentiment for this match.
8.	I’ll proceed on making a cleaning of data, so we could predict the next champion.
9.	Finally, I’ll plot the number of good and bad comments for both teams.
